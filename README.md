# Versatile-ML-Predictor-with-TensorFlowJS-KNN
This is a highly versatile and portable Supervised Machine Learning Program that utilises `TensorFlow.js` to implement the `KNN` algorithm to make prediction (i.e. a Label) based on ANY number/dimention of input data Features

### Instruction for execution
1. Clone the Repo </br> and cd into that cloned directory
2. Install TensorFlow.js and all other related Dependencies specified in `package.json` via command:
`npm install`
3. Execute the entry point script `index.js` using Node.js runtime via command:
`node index.js` (or if you have installed `nodemon` globally, even better, just run command `nodemon`)
